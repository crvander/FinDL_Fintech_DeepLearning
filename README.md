# Project Title: Natural Language Processing: Enhancing Financial Risk Assessment for FinTech Applications

## Project Description
The FinTech package is a set of utilities designed to assist users in the financial domain capture market trends and be alerted by the risk factors. In this project, we fine-tune the popular transformers based on the pretrained models provided by Hugging Face using our collected labeled financial Twitter data.

## Features
- Fine-tuned transformers models for accurate, fast inference
- Provides a way to monitor assets through market sentiment and evaluate the risk of a company from the financial reports
- Information directly from Twitter API

## Usage
Go to the dashboard and select a stock to see the data.

##Future Plans
Our future plan consists of further training and fine-tuning the models to achieve even higher performance. We also plan to expand the package's functionality by adding more financial domain language models and incorporating more advanced sentiment analysis techniques.
